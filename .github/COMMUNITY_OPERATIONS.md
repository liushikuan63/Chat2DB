# Community Operations

This runbook defines how Chat2DB Community work moves from intake to a shipped
release. It is the maintainer contract behind the public
[Community Project](https://github.com/orgs/OtterMind/projects/3).

## Sources Of Truth

Each concern has one owner. Do not duplicate status in labels or comments.

| Concern | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| Submission evidence | Issue form and Issue body |
| Work type | GitHub Issue Type |
| Product classification | `area/*`, `db/*`, `platform/*`, and `edition/*` labels |
| Missing evidence or decision | `needs/*` labels |
| Urgency | Project Priority |
| Lifecycle | Project Status |
| Active contributor | Assignee and the claim bot comment |
| Delivery commitment | Milestone |
| Implementation and verification | Linked pull request |
| User delivery | GitHub Release |

## Automation In Forks

Community CI and CodeQL run in forks. The official repository also enables the
Community operations integrations by default. Forks must explicitly enable
each integration with a repository Actions variable set to the string `true`:

| Integration | Repository variable | Required configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QQ notifications | `ENABLE_QQ_NOTIFICATIONS` | `QQ_RELAY_URL` and `QQ_RELAY_TOKEN` secrets for the fork's relay |
| Community Project sync | `ENABLE_COMMUNITY_PROJECT_SYNC` | `ACCESS_TOKEN` secret and a reviewed Project target |
| AI issue and PR automation | `ENABLE_AI_AUTOMATION` | The API and model secrets required by the AI workflow |
| Dependency review | `ENABLE_DEPENDENCY_REVIEW` | Dependency graph and dependency review support enabled for the repository |

When these variables are unset, the integration jobs are skipped in forks.
The QQ manual workflow can still run with `dry_run: true` to inspect formatting
without configuring a relay or sending a notification. A manual send requires
the QQ integration to be enabled and configured.

Project sync and the QQ delivery workflows execute trusted default-branch
code. Their guards must reach the fork's default branch before they affect
existing PR events. AI workflow source changes must be compiled with `gh aw
compile` and include the matching generated `.lock.yml` files.

## Ownership And Response Targets

The current primary Product, Triage, Review, and Release owner is
[@openai0229](https://github.com/openai0229). A Ready Issue must also name its
review maintainer in the Issue body. A backup reviewer is required before a
task is committed to a Milestone; do not invent a backup when no second
maintainer has accepted the responsibility.

| Event | Target |
| --- | --- |
| P0 Issue acknowledgement | Same day |
| P1 Issue triage | 2 business days |
| P2 Issue triage | 7 calendar days |
| P3 Issue review | Monthly backlog review |
| Question on a Ready Issue | 3 business days |
| First substantive pull request review | 5 business days |
| Follow-up review after contributor changes | 3 business days |

An automated acknowledgement is not a substantive response. If a target will
be missed, the owner must post the blocker and next review date. If review
capacity disappears, remove the `contribution/*` label and move the Issue to
Backlog instead of leaving an unsupported task published.

Sensitive security reports use the private route in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md)
and never enter this public queue.

## End-To-End Flow

### 1. Intake

- Reproducible defects use a Bug form.
- Product improvements use the Feature form.
- Documentation gaps use the Documentation task form.
- Repository, test, build, and maintenance work uses the Maintainer task form.
- Questions and open-ended ideas use GitHub Discussions.
- Pro, Local, or other commercial-edition work is rerouted and is not
  published as a Community contribution task.

New public Issues enter Project Status `Inbox`.

### 2. Triage

The triage maintainer must set exactly one Issue Type and `edition/*` label, at
least one `area/*` or `db/*` label, one Priority, and one Project Status.
Evidence gaps use `needs/info`, `needs/reproduction`, or `needs/decision`.

Choose one outcome:

- close with a concrete duplicate, completion, support, or boundary reason;
- keep in `Backlog` while evidence or a decision is missing;
- assign for internal work;
- turn the Issue into a contributor-ready task.

### 3. Contribution-Fit Gate

Use [`contribution-boundaries.yml`](contribution-boundaries.yml) before
publishing a task.

- `open`: maintainers may scope and publish the task.
- `approval-required`: record the design or ownership decision before work.
- `closed`: do not accept public implementation; explain the reason and offer
  the listed alternative.

An `open` boundary does not make an Issue Ready by itself. Scope, verification,
and review capacity are still mandatory.

### 4. Ready Contract

Before applying a `contribution/*` label, append a `Maintainer Ready Contract`
to the Issue containing all of the following:

```markdown
## Maintainer Ready Contract

- User outcome:
- In scope:
- Non-goals:
- Suggested code or documentation area:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Exact verification:
- Dependencies or required environment:
- Review maintainer: @login
- First substantive review target: 5 business days
- Milestone: version or `Not release-committed`
```

Then set Project Status to `Ready`, set Priority, and apply exactly one of:

- `contribution/good-first-issue` for bounded work with a short setup path and
  an established implementation pattern;
- `contribution/help-wanted` for work that requires broader codebase or domain
  knowledge.

### 5. Claim And Implementation

The contributor comments `/claim`. The bot assigns one seven-day pre-PR lease;
`/claim status`, one `/renew`, and `/unclaim` are supported. The contributor
creates a focused branch, reproduces the baseline, and opens a linked draft or
regular pull request with `Closes #<issue>`.

A linked draft pull request moves the Project item to `In Progress`. A pull
request that is ready for maintainer review moves to `In Review`.

### 6. Review And Merge

Review in this order:

1. Issue scope and non-goals.
2. User-visible correctness and compatibility.
3. Tests and the exact verification contract.
4. Security, privacy, and Community/commercial boundaries.
5. Documentation, migration, and rollback needs.

All required checks and review conversations must pass before merge. When a
pull request targets `main`, the active repository rules require one approving
review, Code Owner approval, approval after the latest push by someone other
than the latest pusher, all required status checks, and resolution of every
review conversation. Trusted Contributors may review and merge only after
GitHub reports that all of these requirements are satisfied. The current role,
review request path, protected ownership paths, beta-build permission, and
release boundaries are documented in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md#trusted-contributors).

### 7. Milestone And Release

Milestones are product delivery windows, never workflow columns. A Milestone
must state the user outcome, due date, release owner, inclusion rule, exit
criteria, and move-out rule. Only scoped work with an owner and executable
acceptance evidence is committed.

Before closing a Milestone, the release owner verifies:

- every included Issue is closed or moved with a public reason;
- release artifacts and checksums exist for the promised platforms;
- updater and Docker paths are checked when applicable;
- release notes link the delivered Issues and pull requests;
- post-release installation or smoke verification is recorded.

Formal version tags use `vX.Y.Z`. The corresponding GitHub Release title uses
`Chat2DB vX.Y.Z`; do not append an edition suffix such as `Community` to the
Release title. Application, installer, and package names may still use
`Chat2DB Community` where the edition distinction is part of the product
identity.

The Milestone closes only after the GitHub Release is published and verified.

## Project State Matrix

| Evidence | Project Status |
| --- | --- |
| New Issue awaiting triage | Inbox |
| Confirmed but not executable | Backlog |
| Ready contract complete, no linked PR | Ready |
| Linked draft or regular PR | In Progress |
| PR ready for maintainer review | In Review |
| Issue closed or PR merged | Done |

The maintainer checks the Project weekly for closed items outside `Done`, open
items in `Done`, Ready items without a `contribution/*` label, published tasks
without a review owner, and expired Milestones.

## Operating Cadence

### Daily

- Triage new P0/P1 Issues.
- Answer contributor questions and pull request reviews due that day.
- Release expired claims through the scheduled claim workflow.

### Weekly

- Empty `Inbox` or record the owner and next action for each remaining item.
- Keep at least six unassigned Ready tasks when review capacity allows: two
  good-first tasks and four help-wanted tasks.
- Reconcile Project status, contribution labels, assignees, linked pull
  requests, and Milestones.

### Monthly

- Review P3 and `needs/decision` backlog items.
- Revisit contribution boundaries whose `review_after` date is approaching.
- Publish counts for new Issues, triaged Issues, Ready tasks, claims, first-time
  contributor pull requests, first review time, merges, and releases.

Metrics describe observed events only. Do not report a successful external
contribution, elapsed response time, claim expiry, or release until that event
has actually occurred.
